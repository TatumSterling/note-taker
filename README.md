## Description
Hi! My name is Tatum Sterling, and this is my Note Taker  application. This application was designed to allows users to enter new notes and save them to a database. I created it to challenge myself by creating a simple full stack application that utilizes user input and saves notes to view later, and I used javascript,CSS,HTML,node.js to bring Note Taker  to life!
        
## Installation
N/A
        
## Usage
To use this application, install anything necessary from the installation section, then click the link below to be redirected to the app. Once opened, you can expect to see a notes page that will allow user to click get started, from there it will take the user to a notes entry page. To navigate, you may use the descriptive buttons to achieve tasks, save new notes, render old ones, and delete saved notes.
